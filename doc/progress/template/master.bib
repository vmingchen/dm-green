  year =	 2010,
  abstract =	 {Distributed in-memory application data caches like
                  memcached are a popular solution for scaling
                  database-driven web sites. These systems are easy to add
                  to existing setups, and increase performance
                  significantly, reducing load on both the database and
                  application servers. Unfortunately, such caches do not
                  integrate well with the database or the application. They
                  do not guarantee transactional consistency, violating the
                  isolation properties of the underlying database. They
                  leave the application responsible for cache management,
                  locating data in the cache and keeping it up to date, a
                  frequent source of application complexity and programming
                  errors. Addressing both of these problems, we introduce a
                  transactional cache, TxCache, with a simple programming
                  model. TxCache ensures that any data seen within a
                  transaction, whether it comes from the cache or the
                  database, reflects a slightly stale but consistent
                  snapshot of the database. TxCache makes it easy to add
                  caching to an application by simply designating functions
                  as cacheable; it automatically caches their results, and
                  invalidates the cached data as the underlying database
                  changes. Our experiments found that adding TxCache
                  increased the throughput of a web application by up to
                  5.2x, only slightly below that of a non-transactional
                  cache, showing that consistency does not have to come at
                  the price of performance.},
